Here is the myriad of ways you can inconvenience me:
  > 'list' - view all your tasks
  > 'todo (task)' - add a simple todo task
  > 'deadline (task) /by (date/time)' - add a task with a deadline
  > 'event (task) /at (date/time)' - add a task with a specified date/time
  > 'update (index) /to (date/time)' - change a task to happen at a new date/time
  > 'bye' - (please for the love of God) let me rest! :)
