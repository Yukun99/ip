Here is the myriad of ways you can inconvenience me:
  > 'list' - view all your tasks
  > 'todo (task)' - add a simple todo task
  > 'deadline (task) /by (date/time)' - add a task to be done by specified date/time
  > 'event (task) /at (date/time)' - add a task that happens at specified date/time
  > 'update (task index) /to (date/time)' - modify the date/time of task at specified index
  > 'delete (task index)' - delete a task
  > 'bye' - (please for the love of God) let me rest! :)
